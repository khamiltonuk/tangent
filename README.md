# Tangent UI Test

The purpose of this test is for you to show us how you would refactor some basic code if you were to write it in the scope of a large project.

The code in this repo works fine and will render a webpage but would *not* scale. How you refactor it is entirely up to you. You can split up the files, remove libraries, add libraries, rewrite the structure completely if you wish.
